#  === Structure of the Qiskit Textbook ===
#
# This textbook is organised into 'courses', which are ordered lists of
# 'sections'. Sections are the smallest unit of content in this textbook,
# i.e. a single Jupyter notebook which is converted to a single web page.
#
# Below is a fake example of a simple course.
#
# - title: My course
#   url: /my-course   # pages in this course will have urls starting with
#                     # 'https://learn.qiskit.org/course/my-course'
#   sections:  # ordered list of notebooks
#     - title: My page  # Appears at top of page and in left sidebar
#       id: my-page     # Stem of the url for this page on the website,
#                       # i.e. this page will have url 'https://learn.qiskit.org/course/my-course/my-page'
#       uuid: a5a86ddc-b519-11ec-b909-0242ac120002  # Unique ID for
#                       # website software to identify pages if names change.
#                       # Generate new ids with https://www.uuidgenerator.net
#       url: /my-course/my-notebook  # Path to source notebook, relative to this file
