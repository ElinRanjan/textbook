The algorithm proceeds by measuring the real and imaginary parts of $\\langle U \\rangle$ by inserting or removing a phase gate from the following circuit.\n",

By using amplitude amplification instead of repeated measurements, a quadratic improvement can be obtained, boosting the accuracy to an optimal $O(1/N)$ known as the 'Heisenberg limit.' \n",
