    "Phase estimation algorithms (PEAs) employ phase kickback and quantum interference to measure the desired phase $\\theta$ on an auxiliary quantum register. Various degrees of classical post processing are required following the interference measurements. PEAs can be broadly categorized as non-iterative or iterative. Standard phase estimation is the best known of the non-iterative algorithms and requires no classical processing. Iterative PEAs typically use only a single auxiliary qubit and require multiple rounds, sometimes adaptive, and might require significant classical computation.\n",
