    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Phase kickback is a quantum-mechanical effect in which a controlled operation affects the relative phase of the controlling qubit. It is a core component of many quantum algorithms and subroutines, including Deutsch's algorithm, phase estimation algorithms, Shor's algorithm, and the HHL algorithm for solving linear systems of equations. It's also a simple demonstration of quantum decoherence and the quantum observer effect. "

    "## Explanation\n",
    "\n",

    "In quantum computing, this is no longer the case. One can still define controlled gates, such as the familiar CX (or CNOT) gate. However, for general quantum states in superposition, the control register *will* be affected by the action of the gate. In fact, as we'll see below, the role of controlled and target registers can be completely reversed!"

    "### Phase Detachment and Diagonal Control Gates\n",
    "\n",
    "Any unitary operation, such as a quantum gate, can be thought of as applying phases to a chosen basis. For example, the $X$ gate applies a relative phase of $\\pi$ between the $\\vert +\\rangle$ and $\\vert -\\rangle$ states.\n",

    "For a unitary acting on multiple systems, it may appear, from the mathematics or verbal description, that the unitary is accomplishing this by applying a phase to one of the two subsystems. However, this is somewhat misleading, as there is no notion of phases associated with a subsystem. Phases can be moved around at will, and are not associated with this qubit or that. Mathematically, for a joint system composed of states $\\vert \\psi \\rangle$ and $\\vert \\phi \\rangle$, \n",

    "This has a particularly interesting implication for controlled gates. If $Q$ is a quantum register with computational states $\\vert j\\rangle$, and $R$ a quantum register with states $\\vert k\\rangle$, we might define a controlled diagonal unitary  $C(D)$ as applying a phase $\\theta_{jk}$ to state $\\vert k\\rangle$ depending on the state $\\vert j\\rangle$. \n",
