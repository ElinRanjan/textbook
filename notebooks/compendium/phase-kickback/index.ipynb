    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of a \"controlled\" gate is less straightforward in quantum, as compared to classical, computing. In classical computing, a controlled gate acts on a so-called *target register* in a way that depends on the state of a separate *control register*.\n",
    "\n",
    "**(Include graphic here of most general control scheme, quantikz?)**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this setting, the controlled register is not changed by the gate, only the target register. The role of the control register merely to dictate which operation is applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "In quantum computing, this is no longer the case. One can still define controlled gates, such as the familiar CX (or CNOT) gate. However, for general quantum states in superposition, the control register *will* be affected by the action of the gate. In fact, as we'll see below, the role of controlled and target registers can be completely reversed!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Phase Detachment\n",
    "\n",
    "Any unitary operation, such as a quantum gate, can be thought of as applying relative phase shifts to a chosen basis. For example, the $X$ gate applies a relative phase of $\\pi$ between the $\\vert +\\rangle$ and $\\vert -\\rangle$ states.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    " X \\vert + \\rangle = \\vert + \\rangle \\qquad X \\vert - \\rangle = e^{i \\pi } \\vert - \\rangle\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that only the relative phase matters here: multiplying $X$ by a complex phase $e^{i\\varphi}$ does not change the effect on the quantum state. Hence the slogan \"global phases are irrelevant.\"  \n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, a unitary $U$ may apply a phase to system with two or more subsystems. It may appear, from the mathematics, that the unitary is accomplishing this by applying a phase to one of the two subsystems. However, this is somewhat misleading, as there is no notion of phases associated with a subsystem. Phases can be moved around at will, and are not associated with this qubit or that. Mathematically, for a joint system composed of states $\\vert \\psi \\rangle$ and $\\vert \\phi \\rangle$, \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\vert \\psi \\rangle \\otimes (e^{i\\theta} \\vert \\phi \\rangle) = (e^{i\\theta} \\vert \\psi \\rangle) \\otimes \\vert \\phi \\rangle = e^{i\\theta} (\\vert \\psi\\rangle \\otimes \\vert \\phi \\rangle).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We see that a phase \"applied to subsystem 2\" can equally be seen as applied to subsystem 1, or to the collective joint state. All points of view lead to the same effect. While it's not a standard term, we might call this property \"phase detachment.\" "

    "## Phase Kickback\n",
    "\n",
    "Phase kickback is a quantum-mechanical effect based on the phase detachment described above, in which a controlled operation affects the relative phase of the controlling qubit. It is a core component of many quantum algorithms and subroutines, including Deutsch's algorithm, phase estimation algorithms, Shor's algorithm, and the HHL algorithm for solving linear systems of equations. It's also a simple demonstration of quantum decoherence and the quantum observer effect. \n",
