    "For the sake of convenience and brevity, we will hereafter use the term *classical state set* to mean any finite and nonempty set.\n",

    "\n",
    "In general, we can represent a probabilistic state of a system having any classical state set in the same way, as a vector of probabilities.\n",
    "The probabilities can be ordered in any way we choose — which is typically determined by some natural or default way to order the classical state set we're working with. To be precise, we can represent any probabilistic state through a column vector satisfying two properties:\n",

    "### Measuring probabilistic states\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let us briefly consider what happens if we *measure* a system when it is in a probabilistic state. By measuring a system, we mean that we look at the system and unambiguously recognize whatever classical state it is in. Intuitively, we can never \"see\" a system in a probabilistic state; a measurement will yield exactly one of the allowed classical states.\n",
    "\n",
    "Measurement changes our knowledge of the system, and therefore changes the probabilistic state that we associate with that system: if we recognize that $\\mathsf{X}$ is in the classical state $a\\in\\Sigma$, then the new probability vector representing our knowledge of $\\mathsf{X}$ becomes a vector having a $1$ in the entry corresponding to $a$ and $0$ for all other entries.\n",
    "This vector indicates that $\\mathsf{X}$ is in the classical state $a$ with certainty, which we know having just recognized it.\n",
    "\n",
    "We denote the vector just described, meaning the vector having a $1$ in the entry corresponding to $a$ and $0$ for all other entries, by $\\vert a\\rangle.$\n",
    "This vector is read as \"ket $a$\" for a reason that will be explained shortly.\n",
    "Vectors of this sort are also called *standard basis* vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, assuming that the system we have in mind is a bit, the standard basis vectors are given by\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "  \\vert 0\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix}1\\\\0\\end{pmatrix}\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If we were to uncover the coin and look at it, we would see one of the two classical states: heads or tails.\n",
    "Supposing that the result were tails, we would naturally update our description of the probabilistic state of the coin so that it becomes $|\\text{tails}\\rangle.$\n",
    "Of course, if we were then to cover up the coin, and then uncover it and look at it again, the classical state would still be tails, which is consistent with the probabilistic state being described by the vector\n",
    "$|\\text{tails}\\rangle.$\n",
    "This may seem trivial, and in some sense it is. However, quantum systems behave in an entirely analogous way, yet their measurement properties are frequently considered unusual or \"spooky.\" By establishing the measurement properties of classical systems, the analogous behavior for quantum information might seem less unusual.\n",
    "\n",
    "One final remark concerning measurements of probabilistic states: they may describe knowledge or belief, not necessarily something actual.\n",
    "The state of our coin after we flip it, but before we look, is either heads or tails, and we simply don't know which until we look. \n",
    "Doing so doesn't actually change the state, but only our knowledge of it.\n",
    "Upon seeing that the classical state is tails, we naturally update our knowledge by assigning the vector $|\\text{tails}\\rangle$ to the coin, but to someone else who didn't see the coin when it was uncovered, the probabilistic state remains unchanged.\n",
    "This is not a cause for concern: different individuals may have different knowledge or beliefs about a particular system, and hence describe that system by different probability vectors."

For example, the following cell shows the outcome of measuring the vector `v` $1000$ times, which (with high probability) results in the outcome $0$ approximately $5$ out of every $9$ times (or about $556$ of the $1000$ trials) and the the outcome $1$ approximately $4$ out of every $9$ times (or about $444$ out of the $1000$ trials).\n",
